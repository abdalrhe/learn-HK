    This is the best kali Linux books to start with, it’s best for beginners,
       this book teaches you from starting points
       an introduction and overview , it also cover important topics such as exploiting Linux
       and Windows, Metasploit, social engineering, password cracking and so on!
       in a simple way with images this book will explain most important topics,
       the primary concern of this book is pentesting for security. It focuses more on How an attacker
       can find and exploit weakness in system, For e.g. How to discover vulnerability in system, which
       can be exploited by a malicious hacker, and this is the most essential skill.

          “The best guide to the Metasploit Framework.”
           It was written by people very close to the project (the creator of SET, the creator 
           of BackTrack, to name two) and the forward was written by HD Moore, the creator 
           of Metasploit.
           The Metasploit Framework makes discovering, exploiting, and sharing vulnerabilities 
           quick and relatively painless. But while Metasploit is used by security professionals
           everywhere, the tool can be hard to grasp for first-time users. Metasploit: 
           The Penetration Tester’s Guide fills this gap by teaching you how to harness 
           the Framework and interact with the vibrant community of Metasploit contributors.
           Once you’ve built your foundation for penetration testing, you’ll learn the Framework’s
           conventions, interfaces, and module system as you launch simulated attacks.
           You’ll move on to advanced penetration testing techniques, including network
           reconnaissance and enumeration, client-side attacks, wireless attacks, and targeted 
           social-engineering attacks.
           Learn how to:

           Find and exploit unmaintained, misconfigured, and unpatched systems
           Perform reconnaissance and find valuable information about your target
           Bypass anti-virus technologies and circumvent security controls
           Integrate Nmap, NeXpose, and Nessus with Metasploit to automate discovery
           Use the Meterpreter shell to launch further attacks from inside the network
           Harness standalone Metasploit utilities, third-party tools, and plug-ins
           Learn how to write your own Meterpreter post exploitation modules and scripts
